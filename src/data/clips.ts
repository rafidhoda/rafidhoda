    article:
      "I got my start on the early social web: Friendster and MySpace. You had to tweak HTML and CSS to make your profile look right, and that little bit of code pulled a lot of us in.\n\nAt nine I found Flash and ActionScript. It was one tool where you could make animations, tiny games, even full sites. There wasn’t much online, so I grabbed a couple of books and wrote simple scripts: click a button, jump to frame 50, play that part. It barely felt like programming, but it was code, and it made building things feel visual and doable.\n\nThat mix of art and interactivity hooked me on software, and I never really let go.",

      "Yeah. Uh, it was really, uh, cool Avi to hear that you started on Friendster, because I also remember Friendster and also MySpace. And that was the beginnings of social media. And then, of course, Mark Zuckerberg came in and then just destroyed everything. But I thought that was so nice back then, that to customize your profile you had to know a little bit of code.\n\nI thought that really taught a lot of that generation coding, an introduction to CSS, HTML, things like that, even a bit of JavaScript. So it's nice to hear that you're from that time. I also started around your age; I was a little bit younger, like nine years old or something. And I started in something called ActionScript, which probably not a lot of you have heard about.\n\nI'd be surprised if a lot of people know here. But there used to be something called Flash back in the day, and then it got replaced by JavaScript. But Flash was really interesting because you could kind of do anything in it. You had one program that one company owned and you could download it and make movies in it, animation films and websites and games and all sorts of things. It was a really interesting creative tool.\n\nAt the time I was very young, around nine years old, and I wanted to make my own little games and things like that. I was a big video game person. And so I remember picking up a book or two back then, there was very little stuff on the internet, and just writing some scripts. It was something like: you press this button and you go from this frame to frame number 50 and you play that portion of it. You couldn't really call it programming, but technically it was code.\n\nSo it kind of started like that in a very visual way. That was my beginning, a long time ago.",

      "I was 14, making scrappy video tutorials before YouTube existed. Most were bad, but one hit: taking a finished Photoshop web design and turning it into a coded site. A big design portal featured it and pointed everyone to the video file I hosted on a tiny free server.\n\nI went to bed in Norway and woke up to a dead site. That was my first lesson in bandwidth, hosting, and scaling: if you invite people to download your stuff, you need the infrastructure to serve it. I begged my dad for three dollars to upgrade hosting so I could keep the tutorial online. It was my first traffic-induced “incident,” and it stuck with me.",

      "This is like 20 years ago. I'm 14 years old and this is before YouTube. At this point I've been coding and building things for about four or five years, so I feel like I know more than the average person. I thought: I should make some video tutorials, which was a big thing back then because I consumed a lot of those.\n\nI started making them and they were horrible, but I kept going. Then I hit one that became very popular because it was what people really wanted to know: taking a fully designed Photoshop website and coding it into a working site. Back then you’d slice the design, make parts into buttons, iframes, links. I knew how to do it, so I made a tutorial and it got traction.\n\nThere was no YouTube, Google was new, and there were portal sites that curated the best resources for Photoshop, Flash, C++, etc. They started reaching out asking to feature my tutorial. I said yes. One of the biggest portals featured it. The video file lived on my tiny free server, and they linked directly to it, so downloads hit my site.\n\nI went to bed (Norway time) and woke up to a dead site. That’s when I learned about bandwidth and infrastructure: if people are downloading your file, you need a server that can handle it. I told my dad we had an emergency, people were hitting my site, so he needed to pay three dollars for a better host to handle the traffic. That was my first big traffic-induced panic.",

      "Imagine going through life and not knowing how numbers work or multiplication, division, geometry. It's like that, but at a higher level. Fundamentals are the things you should know about: how to write, communicate, do math, know a bit of physics and sciences, think critically.\n\nThere are so many things that, if you know them, everything else is just a configuration or permutation on top, an abstraction someone came up with. And if it’s popular, someone probably designed it in the most intuitive way. If you know the fundamentals, learning new things becomes obvious. Given enough time, you could invent something similar yourself.\n\nThat’s where you want to be: not surprised, not memorizing, but seeing why it makes sense. This is why people like Elon Musk can work across fields, they see the same building blocks underneath.\n\nDon’t restrict fundamentals to tech. Think about the universe fundamentals: numbers, exponential growth, laws that go deep. Don’t only watch tech YouTube. Study philosophy, languages, cinema. Have a general curiosity about the world. It will help you in whatever you do. Long-term approach, but it pays off for life.",

Set a timer for 15–60 minutes, record yourself, talk through it, and deploy it no matter how ugly it looks.\n\nThe goal is completion and sharing. A bad but real, deployed thing beats hours of watching tutorials. Do this for 30 days and you will have 30 shipped things, real reps under time pressure, and a public trail of learning. It is how the real world works: deadlines force decisions and focus. Keep each project personal so it feels worth showing. Opportunities start to show up when you have a pile of things you actually built.",

If you're in tutorial hell, watching videos but not really building, this is for you.\n\nYou need to feel like you completed something every single day. Not a giant project that never ships. One tiny project per day. If you just started, it could be a button that changes the background color. If it's obvious to you, go further. If it's not, do it now. Set a timer for 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes max. Record yourself, talk through it, finish it. It can look terrible. It should look terrible. But it must be deployed so someone can see and test it.\n\nAfter you finish, make a one minute video about what you did and learned. Do this every day. One day of this is worth more than a month of just watching tutorials. With a time limit you make decisions on the fly, which is how real projects work. Deadlines force focus. In 30 days you will have 30 projects and you will move way faster than someone chasing a perfect giant build.\n\nStart with simple things, then grow to a to-do list or something personal that someone might actually use. Not a copy from a tutorial, but your own idea. After a couple of months you'll have a pile of shipped things and real experience. If you share them, opportunities will come. This system works. I have seen it help people again and again.",
